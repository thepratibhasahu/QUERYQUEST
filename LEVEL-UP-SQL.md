# RPA Fraud Detection

Reputable Product Agency (RPA) has started receiving complaints from their credit card processor about fraudulent transactions. Help your finance department identify potentially risky transactions before they finish processing.

This dataset contains a single table, `transaction_data`.

**(1.)** Start by getting a feel for the `transaction_data` table:                         
What are the column names?
```SQL
SELECT *
FROM transaction_data
LIMIT 10;
```

**(2.)** The finance department noted that some of the fraudulent transactions were recorded as coming from Smokey Bearâ€™s zip code (20252).                
You agree this is suspicious, itâ€™s unlikely that the fire prevention mascot is using Reputable Companyâ€™s services.          
Find the `full_names` and `emails` of the transactions listing 20252 as the zip code.
```sql
SELECT full_name, email, zip
FROM transaction_data
WHERE zip = 20252;
```
