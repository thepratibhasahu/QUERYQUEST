# Restaurants Introduction

Next up, you will be querying data on restaurants:

* Baby Names
* **Restaurants**
* News Headlines

We need your help to answer some questions and find the best dinner spots in the city!                  

Youâ€™ll work with a table named `nomnom` with six columns.

The nomnom table has the following columns:

* `name` - the restaurant name
* `neighborhood` - the neighborhood name
* `cuisine` - the cuisine type
* `review` - the average user review
* `price` - the price range
* `health` - the health inspection grade

**(1.)** Suppose your friend Jaime wants to go out to Japanese, but youâ€™re on a budget.                      
Return all the restaurants that are `Japanese` and `$$`.                                 
Select all the columns.
```sql
SELECT *
FROM nomnom
WHERE cuisine = 'Japanese'
  AND price = '$$';
```
### ðŸŸ©Output
```sql
+--------+--------------+----------+--------+-------+--------+
|  name  | neighborhood | cuisine  | review | price | health |
+--------+--------------+----------+--------+-------+--------+
| Minca  | Downtown     | Japanese |  4.4   |  $$   |   A    |
| Ippudo | Downtown     | Japanese |  4.4   |  $$   |   A    |
| Ootoya | Downtown     | Japanese |  4.5   |  $$   |   A    |
+--------+--------------+----------+--------+-------+--------+
```
**(2.)** Your roommate Bevers canâ€™t remember the exact name of a restaurant he went to but he knows it contains the word â€˜noodleâ€™ in it.                                  
Can you find it for him using a query?                                   
Select all the columns.
```sql
SELECT * FROM nomnom
WHERE name LIKE '%noodle%';
```
### ðŸŸ©Output
```sql
+------------------------+--------------+---------+--------+-------+--------+
|         name           | neighborhood | cuisine | review | price | health |
+------------------------+--------------+---------+--------+-------+--------+
| Great NY Noodletown    | Chinatown    | Chinese |  4.1   |  $$   |   B    |
+------------------------+--------------+---------+--------+-------+--------+
```
**(3.)** Some of the restaurants have not been inspected yet or are currently appealing their health grade score.   
Find the restaurants that have empty `health` values.                           
Select all the columns.
